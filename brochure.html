        <h1>Welcome to APC</h1>
        <p><strong>To the Parents and Students,</strong></p>
        <p>Jai Swaminarayan. Welcome to the Akshar-Purushottam Chhatralay (APC), a home away from home where education
            meets spirituality. Since its inception, APC has been a beacon of character-building, guiding thousands of
            students towards academic excellence and moral integrity. Our vision, inspired by H.H. Pramukh Swami Maharaj
            and H.H. Mahant Swami Maharaj, is to create not just successful professionals, but ideal citizens who serve
            their families, society, and the nation with humility and values.</p>

        <p>At APC, we believe in 'Vidya', 'Sadvidya', and 'Brahmavidya'. While schools and colleges provide Vidya
            (academic knowledge), APC focuses on Sadvidya (values/character) and Brahmavidya (spiritual wisdom). This
            handbook outlines the discipline, routines, and rules that form the bedrock of this transformative
            experience. It serves as a comprehensive guide for both School Students (attending BAPS Swaminarayan
            Vidyamandir) and College Students (attending innovative universities in Vidyanagar).</p>

        <h2>The APC Philosophy</h2>
        <p>"Sikshapatri ne adhare, jivan ghadtar karvu che." (We wish to mold our lives based on the Shikshapatri). The
            212 verses of the Shikshapatri written by Bhagwan Swaminarayan are the foundation of our code of conduct. We
            strive for a life free from addictions, ego, and impurity. This brochure details the 50 Golden Rules that
            every student must adhere to, to ensure their stay here is fruitful and harmonious.</p>

        <h2>History: The Visionary Founder</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--c-gold);">Brahmaswarup Yogiji Maharaj</h3>
        <p><strong>"Yuvako maru hriday che" (Youth are my heart).</strong></p>
        <p>The genesis of the BAPS student hostel movement lies in the divine vision of Brahmaswarup Yogiji Maharaj. In
            the mid-20th century, as education began to modernize in Gujarat, Yogiji Maharaj foresaw the need for a
            sanctuary where students could pursue higher studies without compromising their moral and spiritual roots.
            He observed that while cities offered colleges, they also offered distractions that could lead youth astray.
            His solution was the 'Chhatralay'—not just a hostel, but a 'Sanskar Dham' (Abode of Culture).</p>

        <p>It was under his inspiration that the first BAPS Chhatralay was established right here in Vallabh Vidyanagar.
            Yogiji Maharaj personally visited the site, blessed the land, and washed the utensils of the first batch of
            students, serving them with his own hands. This act of humility set the tone for the institution: here, the
            leader is the servant of all.</p>

        <p>Yogiji Maharaj established the weekly 'Yuvak Sabha', a forum where students could learn public speaking,
            management, and spirituality. He believed that a student's life should be a tripod of 'Abhyas' (Study),
            'Seva' (Service), and 'Satsang' (Spirituality). If any one leg is missing, the tripod falls. He encouraged
            students to wake up early, study hard, and pray sincerely. His laughter and innocent joy attracted thousands
            of youths, laying the foundation for the massive BAPS youth force we see today. He famously said, "God is
            happy when you study well." This simple mantra continues to motivate APC students to strive for academic
            gold medals as a form of devotion.</p>

        <p class="no-print" style="margin-top: 2rem; border: 1px dashed #ccc; padding: 1rem;">
            <em>"Yogi Bapa's vision was not limited to making engineers and doctors; he wanted to make 'Manushya'—true
                humans who would serve society."</em>
        </p>

    <div class="a4-page">
        <h2>History: The Global Architect</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--c-gold);">Brahmaswarup Pramukh Swami Maharaj</h3>
        <p><strong>"In the joy of others, lies our own."</strong></p>
        <p>If Yogiji Maharaj planted the seed, Brahmaswarup Pramukh Swami Maharaj watered it into a massive banyan tree.
            Taking the reigns as the Guru in 1971, Pramukh Swami Maharaj expanded the Chhatralay network from a handful
            in Gujarat to a global phenomenon with presence in India, UK, USA, and Africa. He recognized that as the
            world became more connected, the challenges facing youth became more complex. Issues like drug addiction,
            depression, and cultural alienation required a robust support system.</p>

        <p>Pramukh Swami Maharaj standardized the APC administration. He introduced the 'Sadhu-sanchalit'
            (Sadhu-managed) model, ensuring that every hostel had resident Saints to guide the students 24/7. This
            unique feature sets BAPS Chhatralays apart. Where else do world-class hostels come with spiritual mentors
            living next door? He emphasized strict discipline—'Niyam' and 'Dharma'. He often told students, "If you lose
            money, you lose nothing; if you lose health, you lose something; but if you lose character, you lose
            everything."</p>

        <p>He visited the Vallabh Vidyanagar APC dozens of times, personally counseling students who were failing in
            exams or struggling with personal issues. His touch transformed lives. Under his guidance, APC produced not
            just industry leaders but dedicated volunteers who built monuments like Akshardham. He taught that
            intelligence without character is dangerous. Therefore, at APC, character reports are as important as
            academic report cards. His life was a testament to the power of pure, selfless love, holding together a
            family of thousands of students across generations.</p>

    <!-- Page 9: History - Mahant Swami Maharaj -->
    <div class="a4-page">
        <h2>History: The Present Guide</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--c-gold);">Pragat Brahmaswarup Mahant Swami Maharaj</h3>
        <p><strong>"Samp, Suhradbhav, and Ekta."</strong></p>
        <p>Today, the legacy is carried forward by Pragat Brahmaswarup Mahant Swami Maharaj. A scholar himself, Mahant
            Swami Maharaj places immense emphasis on 'Vicharan' (thought process) and introspection. He teaches that the
            root of all conflict in student life—whether with roommates or with oneself—is the ego. His solution is
            'Divyabhav' (Divine Outlook): seeing the divine in everyone and everything.</p>

        <p>Mahant Swami Maharaj has introduced a subtle but powerful layer to the APC training: the art of 'positive
            thinking' through spiritual understanding. In an era of high-stress competitive exams, his teachings on
            'Antar-drashti' (looking within) provide students with a psychological armor. He encourages students to
            write a 'Daily Diary' to track their spiritual and academic progress, a practice that boosts
            self-accountability.</p>

        <p>Under his leadership, the APC facilities have been modernized to world-class standards (like the new
            e-libraries and gyms), yet the soul remains ancient. He insists that while technology changes, values must
            not. He often reminds the youth, "You are not just students; you are the ambassadors of Akshar-Purushottam."
            His gentle, microscopic attention to detail ensures that the rules laid down by Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh
            Swami Maharaj are followed not out of fear, but out of love. He is the silent force empowering the current
            generation to face the 21st century with the wisdom of the Vedas.</p>

    <!-- Page 10: Value Essay - Sadvidya -->
    <div class="a4-page">
        <h2>Appendix A: The Value of Sadvidya</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--c-gold);">Sadvidya: The Soul of Education</h3>
        <p>The motto of BAPS Swaminarayan Vidyamandir and Chhatralay is ‘Sadvidya’. But what does it truly mean?
            Establishing the difference between 'Vidya' (Knowledge) and 'Sadvidya' (Good/True Knowledge) is critical. In
            the modern educational landscape, we are churning out data-processors, not thinkers. We are teaching how to
            build bridges, but not how to build bridges between people. We teach how to count money, but not what counts
            in life. Sadvidya fills this gap.</p>

        <p>Sadvidya is the knowledge that liberates one from the shackles of base instincts. At APC, Sadvidya is
            practically applied through the concept of 'Seva' (Service). When a student spends his Sunday sweeping the
            common hall or serving food to his juniors, he learns dignity of labor. He learns that no job is small. This
            emotional intelligence is what corporate recruiters today call 'soft skills'—empathy, teamwork, and
            leadership. At APC, we don't teach these with PowerPoint presentations; we teach them with brooms and
            ladles.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, Sadvidya instills a sense of gratitude. A student here learns to recognize the sacrifices of his
            parents and the grace of God. This gratitude prevents the arrogance that often accompanies academic success.
            A Sadvidya-oriented student knows that his intelligence is a gift to be used for the world's welfare, not
            just for padding his bank account. This worldview creates a professional who is ethical, uncorruptable, and
            compassionate. In a world riddled with corporate scandals and moral decay, an APC alumnus stands out like a
            lion among sheep, shielded by the armor of Sadvidya.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Page 11: Value Essay - Brahmavidya -->
    <div class="a4-page">
        <h2>Appendix B: The Value of Brahmavidya</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--c-gold);">Brahmavidya: The Ultimate Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Beyond academic and moral knowledge lies the highest realm: Brahmavidya, or spiritual knowledge. Following
            the Vedic tradition, APC believes that the ultimate goal of human life is not just career success but
            'Moksha' (Liberation). Brahmavidya is the understanding of one's true self as the Atma, distinct from the
            body, and the realization of the Supreme God (Paramatma).</p>

        <p>For a teenager, this might sound abstract. But at APC, Brahmavidya is taught as a practical tool for mental
            strength. When a student understands, "I am the Atma, eternal and pure; I am not this body or this temporary
            failure in an exam," they gain immense mental resilience. Suicide and depression rates among students are
            climbing globally because their self-worth is tied to temporary things like grades or social media likes.
            Brahmavidya detaches self-worth from these fluctuating metrics and anchors it in the eternal.</p>

        <p>This spiritual education is imparted through the 'Agna' (instructions) and 'Upasana' (philosophy) of the
            Akshar-Purushottam Darshan. Students learn to see God's will in all circumstances. If they pass, it is His
            grace; if they fail, it is His wish and a lesson to learn. This 'Kartapanu' (Doership) of God relieves the
            student of the crushing burden of performance anxiety. They work hard—'Purusharth'—but leave the
            result—'Fal'—to God. This balanced approach creates a peaceful, focused mind capable of achieving wonders.
            Thus, Brahmavidya is not an escape from the world, but the secret to conquering it.</p>
